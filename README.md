This repository hosts the **Speculative Ontological Engine (SOE) Framework** documentation, beginning with our foundational paper, **MMG-TR-001: The Illusion of Fatalism**.

## 📜 Overview: TR-001 Focus

**MMG-TR-001** establishes the core metaphysical and computational argument against Causal Nihilism. It posits that the computational irreducibility of complex agents, defined by the **Unpredictability Horizon ($H_u$)**, preserves functional agency even in a deterministic universe.

The paper introduces and defines:
*   **Agency Depth ($D_A$):** A scalar metric for internal complexity.
*   **Process Sovereignty:** The concept that the agent is the necessary computational bottleneck for its own future resolution.
*   **Salient Cause:** The level of explanation that matters for local outcomes.

This document serves as the **Axiomatic Foundation** for the entire Meaningfulness Media Group (MMG) research program into Cognitive Sovereignty.

## 🗂️ Forthcoming Technical Deep Dives

The following reports are in active development and will be released to provide the formal proofs and practical applications stemming from the axioms established in TR-001:

1.  **MMG-TR-002: Functional Agency in Physical Systems**
    *   **Focus:** This is the most critical follow-up. It will provide the **formal computational proofs** for Agency Depth ($D_A$), utilizing Information Theory (e.g., the Halting Problem) to construct a quantifiable, falsifiable model of the agent’s internal architecture. *This directly addresses the computational claims made in TR-001.*

2.  **MMG-TR-003: Cognitive Sovereignty in Algorithmic Societies**
    *   **Focus:** This report will analyze the **systemic erosion of Agency Depth ($D_A$)** in modern socio-technical systems (like the Attention Economy). It will use the concepts from TR-001 to define new technical and ethical standards for platform accountability.
