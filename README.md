This repository hosts the **Technical Reports** of the Meaningfulness Media Group (MMG). This series represents an interdisciplinary effort to move the human agency debate from abstract metaphysics into the domain of **Systems Engineering**.

We treat the human mind as a high-resolution, self-modeling computational system and provide the rigorous frameworks required to defend human dignity in an age of hyper-resolution predictive modeling.

## 📚 Technical Reports Overview

### [MMG-TR-001] The Illusion of Fatalism
**Focus:** The Substrate Layer (Physics & Metaphysics)  
**Status:** Published | [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18455937](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18455937)

Establishes the physical argument against Causal Nihilism. It demonstrates that whether the universe is deterministic or stochastic, the long-term future remains **physically unresolved** and informationally inaccessible to external observers.
*   **Key Concepts:** Unpredictability Horizon ($H_u$), Salient Causality, Landauer’s Principle.
*   **Takeaway:** The future is "uncomputed"; the agent’s internal processing is the necessary physical work required for the timeline to unfold.

### [MMG-TR-002] Functional Agency in Physical Systems
**Focus:** The Logic Layer (Computer Science & Self-Reference)  
**Status:** Published | [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18511450](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18511450)

Provides a formal computational proof for internal agency. Utilizing the **Halting Problem** and **Computational Irreducibility**, it defines the "Incomputability Firewall" of self-modeling systems.
*   **Key Concepts:** Agency Depth ($D_A$), Effective Agency ($A_e$), Model Fidelity ($R_m$), Process Sovereignty.
*   **Takeaway:** "Free Will" is a technical property of systems where the most efficient way to determine the output is to run the internal deliberation to completion.

### [MMG-TR-003] Cognitive Sovereignty in Algorithmic Societies [Forthcoming]
**Focus:** The Application Layer (Sociology & Policy)  
**Status:** Active Draft / RFC (Request for Comments)

Models the modern "Attention Economy" as an **Adversarial Optimization System**. It analyzes how predictive algorithms bypass System 2 deliberation to render human agents computationally reducible.
*   **Key Concepts:** Ontological Harm, Predictive Resonance ($\rho_p$), The Right to Remain Incomputable, Cognitive Sanctuaries.
*   **Takeaway:** Systematic reduction of human predictability is a structural injury to agency; we must codify "Incomputability" as a foundational digital human right.

## 🚀 Research Roadmap

Our research program is expanding to cover the full stack of human meaning:
*   **MMG-TR-004:** The Socio-Technical Foundations of Agency (Thermodynamic Scaffolding).
*   **MMG-TR-005:** The Spectrum of Ontological Crisis (Diagnosis and Intervention).
*   **MMG-TR-006:** Cognitive Verticality (The 7 Levels of Thinking Depth).
*   **MMG-TR-007:** The Meaningfulness Protocol (Applied Ethics for Connection).
