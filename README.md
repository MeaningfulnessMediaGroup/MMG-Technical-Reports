This repository hosts the **Speculative Ontological Engine (SOE) Framework** documentation, beginning with our foundational paper, **MMG-TR-001: The Illusion of Fatalism**.

## 📜 Overview: TR-001 Focus

**MMG-TR-001** establishes the core metaphysical and computational argument against Causal Nihilism. It posits that the computational irreducibility of complex agents, defined by the **Unpredictability Horizon ($H_u$)**, preserves functional agency even in a deterministic universe.

The paper introduces and defines:
*   **Agency Depth ($D_A$):** A scalar metric for internal complexity.
*   **Process Sovereignty:** The concept that the agent is the necessary computational bottleneck for its own future resolution.
*   **Salient Cause:** The level of explanation that matters for local outcomes.

This document serves as the **Axiomatic Foundation** for the entire Meaningfulness Media Group (MMG) research program into Cognitive Sovereignty.
