# Contributing to Meaningfulness Media Group Research

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Meaningfulness Media Group (MMG) research efforts! We are building a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary framework for understanding agency, truth, and AI in society.

Our goal is to foster a collaborative environment where rigorous, open research can flourish.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in several forms:

1.  **Feedback and Discussion:**
    *   Please submit your thoughts, critiques, suggestions, and questions as **Issues** in the respective repository (e.g., for TR-001, open an issue in `/TR-001 - The Illusion of Fatalism/`).
    *   For broader conceptual discussions or to propose new research directions, use the main repository's Issues tab or the designated GitHub discussion channels.

2.  **Improving Documentation and Examples:**
    *   Help refine the clarity of the ATS framework across modalities (Appendices C and E in ATS).
    *   Contribute to the SOE framework's case studies or suggest new ones (SOE Appendix A).
    *   Test and provide feedback on the Gardener's Calculus worksheet (Gardener Appendix A).

3.  **Developing Forthcoming Technical Reports:**
    *   We are actively seeking collaborators for **MMG-TR-002 (Functional Agency Proofs)** and **MMG-TR-003 (Cognitive Sovereignty in Algorithmic Societies)**. If you have expertise in computational modeling, formal proofs, sociology, or AI policy, we'd love to hear from you.

4.  **Submitting New Research/Frameworks:**
    *   If you have research that aligns with our core principles (agency, truth, AI ethics, systemic modeling), consider submitting it for consideration as a new MMG Technical Report. Please start by opening a discussion in the main repository.
